name = "Anthropology"
tooltip = "The study of living human cultures. Use it to understand morals, religious beliefs, customs, and mores, and to identify (but not translate) obscure languages.

tooltip = "The study of the physical remains of human cultures. Use it to analyze the way of life of a people from ruins, to determine the age of an artifact, to tell a genuine artifact from a fake, and to identify (but not translate) human languages.

It is often complemented SIGINT and by Craft skills like Electrician and Microelectronics."

[[skills]]
name = "Craft"
tooltip = "Making and repairing sophisticated tools and structures. A job that most people could figure out does not require the Craft skill, only an INT or DEX test. Use Craft for specialized work that needs training: Craft (Electrician) to rewire a house, hotwire a vehicle in a hurry, tap a phone or data line, or spot signs of electrical sabotage; Craft (Mechanic) to jury-rig a machine or get a broken engine working—or to sabotage one beyond repair; Craft (Locksmith) to open a lock without a key; Craft (Gunsmith) to repair a broken firearm.

Use it to disarm a bomb, set a charge to destroy a target remotely, jury-rig an explosive from supplies at the hardware store, or analyze a blast to determine exactly what caused it.

At the Handler’s discretion, special training may allow use of the same skill with a closely related language."

This obtains information about a subject—especially information the subject would rather conceal—through observation, conversation, or examining patterns of behavior and relationships. Use HUMINT to recognize signs of dishonesty from verbal cues and body language, gauge attitude and intentions, cultivate sources of information about a subject, determine what it would take to get a subject to cooperate, or recognize clues of what a subject wants to conceal. HUMINT can notice signs of mental illness, but Psychotherapy would be needed to diagnose and treat a specific malady. If your Agent also has Criminology, HUMINT can be used to compile a psychological profile to help find a subject. A subject who deliberately tries to deceive your Agent can attempt a Persuade test to oppose your Agent’s HUMINT."
base = 10

tooltip = "Using laws and courts to your Agent’s advantage. Use it to get your Agent’s way in court, to determine the correct procedures for handling evidence in a prosecution or a civil case (and how to undermine them), to bullshit your Agent’s way out of legal trouble, or to minimize legal risks.

Use it to diagnose the cause of an injury, disease, or poisoning, identify abnormalities such as toxins or diseases, identify the cause and approximate time of death, identify the type of weapon used to kill a victim, identify a dead person’s last meal, or prescribe proper long-term care.

tooltip = "Changing another’s deeply-held decision or desire. Use Persuade to get your Agent’s way when the subject is so stubborn, what your Agent wants is so valuable, or the deception is so flagrant that Charisma isn’t enough. With Persuade, your Agent might convince a witness that what she saw was innocuous and not unnatural, talk a detective into helping you cover up evidence for the greater good, or draw useful intelligence out of an unwilling subject. This skill also allows your Agent to resist persuasion and interrogation in opposed Persuade rolls."

tooltip = "Knowledge of drugs, from their ingredients and creation, to their effects, uses, and misuses. Use it to identify and produce medicines and antidotes—as well as poisons. Identifying a drug requires at least 20% skill. Preparing a particularly powerful drug safely, such as one with psychoactive effects, requires at least 40% skill or a successful roll. Misusing Pharmacy is a quick way to kill a patient."

name = "Search"
tooltip = "Finding things that are concealed or obscured from plain sight. Searching a scene may not require the Search skill, only time and effort, or a sufficiently high INT.
